# Q.3

a + b = -c

Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]

```
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """

```

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {

    }
};
```

# Q.4

Determine if a Sudoku is valid, according to: Sudoku Puzzles - The Rules.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.


A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

Note:
A valid Sudoku board (partially filled) is not necessarily solvable. Only the filled cells need to be validated.

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {

    }
};
```
